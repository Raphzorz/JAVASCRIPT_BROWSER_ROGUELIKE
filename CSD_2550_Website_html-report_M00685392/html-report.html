Padding was applied to nearly every element seen inside of the webpage. Margins were also used to create space between one element and another however this is created using space outside of the element borders while padding creates space inside of its borders.
                                            The text "Copyright Chrono Spark 2018" has a margin-top applied to it so as to create space between itself and the social icons above it. On the other hand the hamburger icon that appears on smaller screens uses "padding: 0.75rem;" to manipulate its size.</p>

These classes are then used inside of the CSS file to point to particular elements and style them in some way. Usage of classes allows elements of the same type to be styled differently.
                                                For example instead of having to have all h1's as the same style the class "landing" is given to the h1 inside of the index page. This is then styled inside of the CSS file in a different way to the h1 without the class "landing"</p>
                                            <p class="mb-1">Classes are used throughout the document wherever content needs to be styled differently to other elements of the same style. Clasees are also used to avoid duplicating code for elements which you do need to share common style attributes. Multiple classes
                                                are applied to some elements to inherit different styles defined in different classes</p>

It must be unique within that HTML document. IDs are primarily used by javascript but may be used in a CSS stylesheet in the same way as classes apart from the fact that
                                                a "#" must be used instead of a "." prior to selecting the ID. IDs have the advantage of having the ability to be referenced by hyperlinks through the use of the "href=" code. IDs were used inside of the navBar and the sign-up page so as to allow for simple javascript functions
                                                to act on the elements.</p>

                                                <p>Bootstrap grid was used across multiple pages. It uses a combination of containers, rows and columns to structure the page. A grid in bootstrap is split into 12 pre-defined columns and multiple rows. Homepage screen shot 2 shows one such example. The code snippet shows how the div in which the images
                                                are located is given the class "col-md-4". The col refers to columns, the "md" means that the structure will apply to medium, large and extra large devices but not small. or extra small. The 4 refers to taking up 4 "slots" of the 12. As 3 of these columns are generated it means that every element will take
                                                up an equal 1/3rd of the allocated width. Home page screen shot 3 shows a different layout. Two columns are created using "col-lg-6". One column contains the text while the other contains the image. Both take up half the available width due to 12/6</p>

                                                <p>CSS grid was used inside of the play-guide to set up a responsive grid structure. Inside of the CSS a "template area" was defined. The grid is made up of 6 columns and 5 rows on a large display. The grid gap is responsible for creating the padding between grid items. Once the
                                                "template" has been defined inside of the CSS the grid items are assigned to every template area ( as can be seen inside of the code snippet). This leads rise to the play-guide page structure. Different templates are set up for different screen widths so as to make the page mobile responsive.</p>
